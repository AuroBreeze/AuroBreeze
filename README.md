### ❄️ About me

- Undergrad focused on **Operating Systems & Low-level Engineering**.
- Passionate about building bare-metal software using **C, Rust, and Assembly**.
- Dedicated to reading **kernel sources, toolchain docs, and hardware manuals**.
- Driven by the desire to understand the machine from first principles:
  `NAND Gates → CPU → ISA → OS Kernel → User Space`
